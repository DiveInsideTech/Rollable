# Rollable

Rollable is a simple and my first Unity game. It has some cubes, of two types. One is purple big cubes, which represent enemies, and small yellow ones, which appear to be coins/collectibles. 
Please don't judge this game, and I wouldn't reccommend mobile users to use this, since I haven't tested whether it works on mobile or not.
This is my first 3D game after all, so it won't be perfect.
Hope you enjoy!
